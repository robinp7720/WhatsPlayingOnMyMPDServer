# WhatsPlayingOnMyMPDServer
WhatsPlayingOnMyMPDServer hosts a dynamically generated image of the currently playing music file on an MPD server.

To run this yourself, simply set the ```MPD_HOST```, ```MPD_PORT``` and ```MPD_PATH``` environment variables.
```MPD_PATH``` needs to point the directory where your music is stored. It's used to retrieve the media posters.

## Demo
